The Random.py file is a Random class containing methods to produce dice rolls.

The DieRollSum.py file uses this to produce the sum of two rolled dice. The default probabilities for a die are equal for the 6 numbers.

Number of rolls, number of experiments, and probabilities for number rolled can be specified from the command line using "-Nroll", "-Nexp", "-prob1", "-prob2", "-prob3", "-prob4", and "-prob5", respectively.
